The Newspaper BEAT

Here a user can add and edit beats, and add individual reporters to individual beats, view a reporter's profile, and search through reporters and beats.  Little styling has been added, but more will be, soon.

Although this meets the requirements of the assessment, I still must concede defeat on this task.  An attempt to make the user able to edit new keys into the Reporter object, so that a user could easily input a name and deal with the rest later, was what I worked on for too long before simply adding those attributes to the addReporter function.

The problem was that, although I could find the id of an individual Reporter object and input new key values, those values came back undefined in JS.  Many different strategies led to the same undefined value.  

I have left this bug up, so that I can talk with folks about it in the weeks to come, and eventually figure out the solution.
